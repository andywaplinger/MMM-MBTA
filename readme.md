# MMM-MBTA

This MagicMirrorÂ² Module is designed to pull information from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's API and to
show and filter data.

For this to work, you need to create your own MBTA API key. You can get one by following [this link][mbta dev portal] and 
signing up. Note that it may take up to a day to approve your api key, according to their website.


**DISCLAIMER**

The times provided are from MBTA's API. As a result, the predicted values may be off. Please only use this as an estimation. i am not responsible for missed transportation and any consequences as a result of it. This is not a precise tool, nor have I claimed it to be. By using this module, you agree to never assume that this is a precise tool, and that I take no fault in any missed appointments, finals, etc.

## Installation

In your terminal, go to your MagicMirror's Module folder:

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
```
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/edward-shen/MMM-MBTA.git
```
Configure the module in your config.js file.

## Using the module

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
```js
modules: [
    {
        module: 'MMM-MBTA',
        position: 'top_right', // This can be any of the regions.
        header: "MBTA:",
        config: {
            apikey: 'your_api_key',
        }
    }
]
```

## Configuration options

Option|Description

## Known Bugs
- On boot up, it takes a very long time to diplay your options

  This can be fixed by setting up a reciever for the system notification `DOM_OBJECTS_CREATED` and start our update loop from there

- Gondola and funicular icons are unsupported!

  This is intentional. Unless there's a Font Awesome icon, or one that resembles one, I'm not adding it in, because there shouldn't be gondolas and funiculars in Boston anyways.
