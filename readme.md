# MMM-MBTA

This MagicMirrorÂ² Module is designed to pull information from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's API and to
show and filter data.

For this to work, you need to create your own MBTA api key. You can get one by following [this link][mbta dev portal] and 
signing up. Note that it may take up to a day to approve your api key, according to their website.

## Installation
